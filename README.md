# cyber-exercises
Team exercises to gain experience in range building, defensive operations, and offensive operations.

## Purpose

The goal is to engage our team with quarterly exercises to keep our skills relavent and perform research at a team level. We are making this open-source to share our findings and provide a framework that other organizations can follow to test their own skills.

*Note:* Unlike most "exercises" the primary purpose of this type of exercise is to LEARN! The red team is not trying to defeat the blue team... It should be approached with an open-mind and willingness to share as much information as possible

## Team Organization

Individuals will be divided among the following teams:
- Green (Range Building)
- Blue (Defensive Operations)
- Red (Offensive Operations)
- Optionally: It can be helpful to have someone organize and lead the exercise, but this doesn't need to be a dedicated position.

**1 member per team!** This is important!! If you have more than 3 members participating, create another team. This allows everyone to get hands-on experience and prevents anyone from doing a majority of the work. Everyone will still be focused on the same technique per exercise. For example, if you have 6 individuals, there will be 2 ranges each with their own red and blue team. 

For the next exercise, rotate team members to broaden skills and experience.

## Timeline

Distributed and remote work:
- The estimated time to complete an exercise is 1-month from start to finish. This allows members to complete their other daily tasks and not impact daily operations. 

In-Person dedicated exercise time:
- The exercise can be completed in about 2 days.

Timelines can be flexible and adjusted based on your workload and availability.

## Exercise Flow

1. The exercise lead will choose a technique to focus on. For simplicity, we are aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The exercise lead will also establish any environment or scenario restrictions.

2. Individuals will be assigned to their respective teams and roles.

3. All team members will spend time doing research on requirements and a targeted approach.

4. Requirements (software or configuration) from the Blue and Red teams will be submitted to the Green team to be built into the range. 

5. Green team will focus on building the range environment.

6. Once the range is built, the Blue and Red teams will spend a bit of time on the range and adjust any final configurations.

7. The exercise operations will begin with the Red team launching their first attack.

8. Ample time will be given for the Blue team to find evidence of the attack and document the findings. 

9. Continue to repeat attack and defend for any additional TTPs.

10. Schedule a follow-on Exercise Review and publish the results.

*Note:* Information sharing is key! At no point should information be witheld from any team members. The Red Team should make the Blue team aware of the specific methods they are using for the attack. 

Remember, the overall goal is learning! Good luck and happy hunting!
